# Phase 09.1 Plan 02: Shared Components Summary

**All shared components (header, footer, forms, cards) updated from coral to purple color palette with soft shadow support**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 6 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-06T20:33:39Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-06T20:39:16Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 6

## Accomplishments
- Header uses purple for active nav states and hover effects
- Footer uses purple for social icons and link hovers
- Contact form uses purple for focus states, checkbox, and submit button
- Cookie consent uses purple for accept button and privacy link
- Google map uses purple for placeholder icon and show map button
- Card component documented with soft shadow variants (shadow-soft-md, shadow-soft-lg)

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Update header.tsx with purple styling** - `3bbb257` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Update footer.tsx and remaining components** - `435faa9` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Add soft shadow variant to card.tsx** - `58b9ca9` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `components/header.tsx` - Purple nav active/hover states (desktop and mobile)
- `components/footer.tsx` - Purple social icons and link hovers
- `components/contact-form.tsx` - Purple focus states, checkbox, privacy link, submit button
- `components/cookie-consent.tsx` - Purple accept button and privacy link
- `components/google-map.tsx` - Purple placeholder icon and show map button
- `components/ui/card.tsx` - Upgraded default shadow, added soft shadow documentation

## Decisions Made
- Card default shadow upgraded from shadow-sm to shadow-md for better visual depth
- Soft shadow variants (shadow-soft-md, shadow-soft-lg) documented via JSDoc rather than adding cva variants, keeping the simple shadcn pattern

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- All shared components now use purple color palette
- Zero coral references remain in components/ directory
- Ready for Phase 09.1-03 (page-level component updates) or Phase 10 (Polish)
